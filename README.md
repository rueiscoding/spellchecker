Our implementation of spellchecker is as follows:
(1) dictionary.c: This program converts a dictionary file into a trie data structure. Additionally, it also verifies the validity of words by traversing the trie.
(2) traverse.c: A program designed to recursively navigate through directories.
(3) readfile.c: This program reads input files and identifies misspelled words within the file, marking them with row and column numbers.
(4) driver.c: This program integrates all parts of the spellchecker together.
